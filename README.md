2.加css加JavaScript

3.加特殊功能 。。 再说

后端：。。。。再说

1. (due:3.4) 参考以上网页，把他们网页的框架概念提炼出来然后写成非常粗略的html（就是哪一块包含什么信息)，再给我爸看看，需要改成什么样的框架
2. (due:3.6) 然后和我father确定网页的展示信息： 分哪几个模块 展示什么信息
3. 网页设计分析（一起），分工
4. pair programming

后端以及其他部分的要求，建议先做到B然后再考虑A：

JS: this is client-side JavaScript for effects or animation or interaction, including use of client-side frameworks, but excluding aspects which are to do with dynamic page construction

* C means you've got some scripting to work, by writing a small amount of JavaScript, or by slightly adapting a script you found, or by closely following a tutorial

* B means you've written a substantial script yourself, or written a number of script functions with different issues involved, or gained a medium amount of experience with client-side frameworks

* A means you have gained a high level of understanding of how client-side JavaScript works, or a high level of expertise in using client-side frameworks

PNG: this is working with bitmap graphics in Gimp or Krita

* C means you've sorted out basic skills such as converting images to PNG, cropping away unwanted edges, changing resoluation

* B means you've gained experience with some basic tools such as using filters or changing colours or combining existing images or creating simple shapes or filling

* A means you have gained experience with some more sophisticated tools such as handling layers and transparency, or airbrushing or creating original artwork

SVG: this is working with vector graphics in Inkscape

* C means you've created a basic drawing in Inkscape, probably by copying something else

* B means you've gained experience with some of Inkscape's features such as shape tools, freehand drawing, simplification

* A means you have gained a higher level of experience, e.g. with path editing, grouping, transformations, gradients, patterns, etc., or put a lot of effort into vector artwork

Server: this is creating or adapting a server, either programming it yourself or using express and its add-ons

* C means you've created a server by minimally adapting the one provided, or closely following a tutorial to set up express

* B means you've dealt with things like port numbers, URL validation, content negotiation for old browsers, sending redirections to browsers, handling UTF-8

* A means you've dealt with things like https and certificates, or web sockets, or cloud hosting, or security issues beyond URL validation, or auto-testing, or cookies, or running under reduced privilege

Database: this is integrating a database with your server

* C means you've manually created a database, and then extracted data from it in your server

* B means you've managed to update or insert data as well as extract it, and you've got the hang of callbacks for getting things to happen in the right order

* A means you've gained a lot of experience with SQL, or you've put a lot of effort into organising database access (e.g. into a separate server-side module) or you've put a lot of effort into database design or details of handling your data

Dynamic pages: this is either inserting data into templates on the server side and delivering dynamic pages or requesting data from the server and inserting into existing pages on the client side

* C means you've created a simple dynamic delivery system or you have used a framework in a simple way

* B means you've organised dynamic delivery in a more sophisticated way, either doing more of your own programming or using more features of a framework

* A means you've put in a lot of programming effort or become very fluent in using your chosen framework
